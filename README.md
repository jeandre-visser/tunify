# Tunify

A seamless and responsive Spotify clone application built with React, Tailwind, and Redux!

Check out the deployed application here: https://tunify-music-app.netlify.app/

***NOTE: If the link does not display any songs, it is due to my RapidAPI paid subscription being expired (api where all the song data is fetched from). Please then refer to the screenshots below!***

## Description

- Browse or search any song, artist, or genre of music to your liking!
- Select 'Your Country' in the sidebar menu and popular songs within your country will be displayed.
- Select any song by pressing play and the music player will slide in to the bottom of the screen.
